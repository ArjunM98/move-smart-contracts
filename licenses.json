Support `http` and `https`.\n\n## What's different from original `http.Agent`?\n\n- `keepAlive=true` by default\n- Disable Nagle's algorithm: `socket.setNoDelay(true)`\n- Add free socket timeout: avoid long time inactivity socket leak in the free-sockets queue.\n- Add active socket timeout: avoid long time inactivity socket leak in the active-sockets queue.\n\n## Install\n\n```bash\n$ npm install agentkeepalive --save\n```\n\n## new Agent([options])\n\n* `options` {Object} Set of configurable options to set on the agent.\n  Can have the following fields:\n  * `keepAlive` {Boolean} Keep sockets around in a pool to be used by\n    other requests in the future. Default = `true`.\n  * `keepAliveMsecs` {Number} When using the keepAlive option, specifies the initial delay\n    for TCP Keep-Alive packets. Ignored when the keepAlive option is false or undefined. Defaults to 1000.\n    Default = `1000`.  Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.\n  * `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout`: {Number} Sets the free socket to timeout\n    after `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout` milliseconds of inactivity on the free socket.\n    Default is `15000`.\n    Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.\n  * `timeout`: {Number} Sets the working socket to timeout\n    after `timeout` milliseconds of inactivity on the working socket.\n    Default is `freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout * 2`.\n  * `maxSockets` {Number} Maximum number of sockets to allow per\n    host. Default = `Infinity`.\n  * `maxFreeSockets` {Number} Maximum number of sockets to leave open\n    in a free state. Only relevant if `keepAlive` is set to `true`.\n    Default = `256`.\n  * `socketActiveTTL` {Number} Sets the socket active time to live, even if it's in use.\n    If not setted the behaviour continues the same (the socket will be released only when free)\n    Default = `null`.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nconst http = require('http');\nconst Agent = require('agentkeepalive');\n\nconst keepaliveAgent = new Agent({\n  maxSockets: 100,\n  maxFreeSockets: 10,\n  timeout: 60000,\n  freeSocketKeepAliveTimeout: 30000, // free socket keepalive for 30 seconds\n});\n\nconst options = {\n  host: 'cnodejs.org',\n  port: 80,\n  path: '/',\n  method: 'GET',\n  agent: keepaliveAgent,\n};\n\nconst req = http.request(options, res => {\n  console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);\n  console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));\n  res.setEncoding('utf8');\n  res.on('data', function (chunk) {\n    console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);\n  });\n});\nreq.on('error', e => {\n  console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message);\n});\nreq.end();\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  if (keepaliveAgent.statusChanged) {\n    console.log('[%s] agent status changed: %j', Date(), keepaliveAgent.getCurrentStatus());\n  }\n}, 2000);\n\n```\n\n### `getter agent.statusChanged`\n\ncounters have change or not after last checkpoint.\n\n### `agent.getCurrentStatus()`\n\n`agent.getCurrentStatus()` will return a object to show the status of this agent:\n\n```js\n{\n  createSocketCount: 10,\n  closeSocketCount: 5,\n  timeoutSocketCount: 0,\n  requestCount: 5,\n  freeSockets: { 'localhost:57479:': 3 },\n  sockets: { 'localhost:57479:': 5 },\n  requests: {}\n}\n```\n\n### Support `https`\n\n```js\nconst https = require('https');\nconst HttpsAgent = require('agentkeepalive').HttpsAgent;\n\nconst keepaliveAgent = new HttpsAgent();\n// https://www.google.com/search?q=nodejs&sugexp=chrome,mod=12&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8\nconst options = {\n  host: 'www.google.com',\n  port: 443,\n  path: '/search?q=nodejs&sugexp=chrome,mod=12&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8',\n  method: 'GET',\n  agent: keepaliveAgent,\n};\n\nconst req = https.request(options, res => {\n  console.log('STATUS: ' + res.statusCode);\n  console.log('HEADERS: ' + JSON.stringify(res.headers));\n  res.setEncoding('utf8');\n  res.on('data', chunk => {\n    console.log('BODY: ' + chunk);\n  });\n});\n\nreq.on('error', e => {\n  console.log('problem with request: ' + e.message);\n});\nreq.end();\n\nsetTimeout(() => {\n  console.log('agent status: %j', keepaliveAgent.getCurrentStatus());\n}, 2000);\n```\n\n## [Benchmark](https://github.com/node-modules/agentkeepalive/tree/master/benchmark)\n\nrun the benchmark:\n\n```bash\ncd benchmark\nsh start.sh\n```\n\nIntel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU     P8600  @ 2.40GHz\n\nnode@v0.8.9\n\n50 maxSockets, 60 concurrent, 1000 requests per concurrent, 5ms delay\n\nKeep alive agent (30 seconds):\n\n```js\nTransactions:          60000 hits\nAvailability:         100.00 %\nElapsed time:          29.70 secs\nData transferred:        14.88 MB\nResponse time:            0.03 secs\nTransaction rate:      2020.20 trans/sec\nThroughput:           0.50 MB/sec\nConcurrency:           59.84\nSuccessful transactions:       60000\nFailed transactions:             0\nLongest transaction:          0.15\nShortest transaction:         0.01\n```\n\nNormal agent:\n\n```js\nTransactions:          60000 hits\nAvailability:         100.00 %\nElapsed time:          46.53 secs\nData transferred:        14.88 MB\nResponse time:            0.05 secs\nTransaction rate:      1289.49 trans/sec\nThroughput:           0.32 MB/sec\nConcurrency:           59.81\nSuccessful transactions:       60000\nFailed transactions:             0\nLongest transaction:          0.45\nShortest transaction:         0.00\n```\n\nSocket created:\n\n```\n[proxy.js:120000] keepalive, 50 created, 60000 requestFinished, 1200 req/socket, 0 requests, 0 sockets, 0 unusedSockets, 50 timeout\n{\" <10ms\":662,\" <15ms\":17825,\" <20ms\":20552,\" <30ms\":17646,\" <40ms\":2315,\" <50ms\":567,\" <100ms\":377,\" <150ms\":56,\" <200ms\":0,\" >=200ms+\":0}\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n[proxy.js:120000] normal   , 53866 created, 84260 requestFinished, 1.56 req/socket, 0 requests, 0 sockets\n{\" <10ms\":75,\" <15ms\":1112,\" <20ms\":10947,\" <30ms\":32130,\" <40ms\":8228,\" <50ms\":3002,\" <100ms\":4274,\" <150ms\":181,\" <200ms\":18,\" >=200ms+\":33}\n```\n\n## License\n\n```\n(The MIT License)\n\nCopyright(c) node-modules and other contributors.\nCopyright(c) 2012 -

When attempting to compile a non-matching file it's returned verbatim. |\n| `parserOpts`             | `{}`                 | An object containing the options to be passed down to the babel parser, babylon |\n| `plugins`                | `[]`                 | List of [plugins](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins) to load and use. |\n| `presets`                | `[]`                 | List of [presets](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/plugins#presets) (a set of plugins) to load and use. |\n| `retainLines`            | `false`              | Retain line numbers. This will lead to wacky code but is handy for scenarios where you can't use source maps. (**NOTE:** This will not retain the columns) |\n| `resolveModuleSource`    | `null`               | Resolve a module source ie. `import \"SOURCE\";` to a custom value. Called as `resolveModuleSource(source, filename)`. |\n| `shouldPrintComment`     | `null`               | An optional callback that controls whether a comment should be output or not. Called as `shouldPrintComment(commentContents)`. **NOTE:** This overrides the `comment` option when used. |\n| `sourceFileName`         | `(filenameRelative)` | Set `sources[0]` on returned source map. |\n| `sourceMaps`             | `false`              | If truthy, adds a `map` property to returned output. If set to `\"inline\"`, a comment with a sourceMappingURL directive is added to the bottom of the returned code. If set to `\"both\"` then a `map` property is returned as well as a source map comment appended. **This does not emit sourcemap files by itself!** To have sourcemaps emitted using the CLI, you must pass it the `--source-maps` option. |\n| `sourceMapTarget`        | `(filenameRelative)` | Set `file` on returned source map. |\n| `sourceRoot`             | `(moduleRoot)`       | The root from which all sources are relative. |\n| `sourceType`             | `\"module\"`           | Indicate the mode the code should be parsed in. Can be either \"script\" or \"module\". |\n| `wrapPluginVisitorMethod`| `null`               | An optional callback that can be used to wrap visitor methods. **NOTE:** This is useful for things like introspection, and not really needed for implementing anything. Called as `wrapPluginVisitorMethod(pluginAlias, visitorType, callback)`.\n"

However,\nyou may be dealing with AST constructed from multiple sources - JS files, templates, etc.\nIf this is the case, and you want the sourcemaps to reflect the correct sources, you'll need\nto pass an object to `generate` as the `code` parameter.  Keys\nshould be the source filenames, and values should be the source content.\n\nHere's an example of what that might look like:\n\n```js\nimport {parse} from 'babylon';\nimport generate from 'babel-generator';\n\nconst a = 'var a = 1;';\nconst b = 'var b = 2;';\nconst astA = parse(a, { sourceFilename: 'a.js' });\nconst astB = parse(b, { sourceFilename: 'b.js' });\nconst ast = {\n  type: 'Program',\n  body: [].concat(astA.program.body, astB.program.body)\n};\n\nconst { code, map } = generate(ast, { sourceMaps: true }, {\n  'a.js': a,\n  'b.js': b\n});\n\n// Sourcemap will point to both a.js and b.js where appropriate.\n```\n"

When in loose mode these are allowed to be used anywhere.\n\nAnd by default, when using exports with babel a non-enumerable `__esModule` property\nis exported.\n\n```javascript\nvar foo = exports.foo = 5;\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\n```\n\nIn environments that don't support this you can enable loose mode on `babel-plugin-transform-es2015-modules-commonjs`\nand instead of using `Object.defineProperty` an assignment will be used instead.\n\n```javascript\nvar foo = exports.foo = 5;\nexports.__esModule = true;\n```\n\n### `strict`\n\n`boolean`, defaults to `false`\n\nBy default, when using exports with babel a non-enumerable `__esModule` property\nis exported. In some cases this property is used to determine if the import _is_ the\ndefault export or if it _contains_ the default export.\n\n```javascript\nvar foo = exports.foo = 5;\n\nObject.defineProperty(exports, \"__esModule\", {\n  value: true\n});\n```\n\nIn order to prevent the `__esModule` property from being exported, you can set\nthe `strict` option to `true`.\n\n### `noInterop`\n\n`boolean`, defaults to `false`\n\nBy default, when using exports with babel a non-enumerable `__esModule` property\nis exported. This property is then used to determine if the import _is_ the default\nexport or if it _contains_ the default export.\n\n```javascript\n\"use strict\";\n\nvar _foo = require(\"foo\");\n\nvar _foo2 = _interopRequireDefault(_foo);\n\nfunction _interopRequireDefault(obj) {\n  return obj && obj.__esModule ? obj : { default: obj };\n}\n```\n\nIn cases where the auto-unwrapping of `default` is not needed, you can set the\n`noInterop` option to `true` to avoid the usage of the `interopRequireDefault`\nhelper (shown in inline form above).\n"

For example the `es6-promise` library exposes itself\nas `global.Promise` rather than `global.es6Promise`. This can be accommodated by:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    [\"transform-es2015-modules-umd\", {\n      \"globals\": {\n        \"es6-promise\": \"Promise\"\n      }\n    }]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n#### Default semantics\n\nThere are a few things to note about the default semantics.\n\n_First_, this transform uses the\n[basename](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basename) of each import to generate\nthe global names in the UMD output. This means that if you're importing\nmultiple modules with the same basename, like:\n\n```js\nimport fooBar1 from \"foo-bar\";\nimport fooBar2 from \"./mylib/foo-bar\";\n```\n\nit will transpile into two references to the same browser global:\n\n```js\nfactory(global.fooBar, global.fooBar);\n```\n\nIf you set the plugin options to:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"globals\": {\n    \"foo-bar\": \"fooBAR\",\n    \"./mylib/foo-bar\": \"mylib.fooBar\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nit will still transpile both to one browser global:\n\n```js\nfactory(global.fooBAR, global.fooBAR);\n```\n\nbecause again the transform is only using the basename of the import.\n\n_Second_, the specified override will still be passed to the `toIdentifier`\nfunction in [babel-types/src/converters](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/packages/babel-types/src/converters.js).\nThis means that if you specify an override as a member expression like:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"globals\": {\n    \"fizzbuzz\": \"fizz.buzz\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nthis will _not_ transpile to `factory(global.fizz.buzz)`. Instead, it will\ntranspile to `factory(global.fizzBuzz)` based on the logic in `toIdentifier`.\n\n_Third_, you cannot override the exported global name.\n\n#### More flexible semantics with `exactGlobals: true`\n\nAll of these behaviors can limit the flexibility of the `globals` map. To\nremove these limitations, you can set the `exactGlobals` option to `true`.\nDoing this instructs the plugin to:\n\n1. always use the full import string instead of the basename when generating\nthe global names\n2. skip passing `globals` overrides to the `toIdentifier` function. Instead,\nthey are used exactly as written, so you will get errors if you do not use\nvalid identifiers or valid uncomputed (dot) member expressions.\n3. allow the exported global name to be overridden via the `globals` map. Any\noverride must again be a valid identifier or valid member expression.\n\nThus, if you set `exactGlobals` to `true` and do not pass any overrides, the\nfirst example of:\n\n```js\nimport fooBar1 from \"foo-bar\";\nimport fooBar2 from \"./mylib/foo-bar\";\n```\n\nwill transpile to:\n\n```js\nfactory(global.fooBar, global.mylibFooBar);\n```\n\nAnd if you set the plugin options to:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"globals\": {\n    \"foo-bar\": \"fooBAR\",\n    \"./mylib/foo-bar\": \"mylib.fooBar\"\n  },\n  \"exactGlobals\": true\n}\n```\n\nthen it'll transpile to:\n\n```js\nfactory(global.fooBAR, global.mylib.fooBar)\n```\n\nFinally, with the plugin options set to:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"plugins\": [\n    \"external-helpers\",\n    [\"transform-es2015-modules-umd\", {\n      \"globals\": {\n        \"my/custom/module/name\": \"My.Custom.Module.Name\"\n      },\n      \"exactGlobals\": true\n    }]\n  ],\n  \"moduleId\": \"my/custom/module/name\"\n}\n```\n\nit will transpile to:\n\n```js\nfactory(mod.exports);\nglobal.My = global.My || {};\nglobal.My.Custom = global.My.Custom || {};\nglobal.My.Custom.Module = global.My.Custom.Module || {};\nglobal.My.Custom.Module.Name = mod.exports;\n```\n\n### Via CLI\n\n```sh\nbabel --plugins transform-es2015-modules-umd script.js\n```\n\n### Via Node API\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\"babel-core\").transform(\"code\", {\n  plugins: [\"transform-es2015-modules-umd\"]\n});\n```\n"

You can\noverride this by passing an ignore regex via:\n\n```js\nrequire(\"babel-register\")({\n  // This will override `node_modules` ignoring - you can alternatively pass\n  // an array of strings to be explicitly matched or a regex / glob\n  ignore: false\n});\n```\n\n## Specifying options\n\n```javascript\nrequire(\"babel-register\")({\n  // Optional ignore regex - if any filenames **do** match this regex then they\n  // aren't compiled.\n  ignore: /regex/,\n\n  // Ignore can also be specified as a function.\n  ignore: function(filename) {\n    if (filename === \"/path/to/es6-file.js\") {\n      return false;\n    } else {\n      return true;\n    }\n  },\n\n  // Optional only regex - if any filenames **don't** match this regex then they\n  // aren't compiled\n  only: /my_es6_folder/,\n\n  // Setting this will remove the currently hooked extensions of .es6, `.es`, `.jsx`\n  // and .js so you'll have to add them back if you want them to be used again.\n  extensions: [\".es6\", \".es\", \".jsx\", \".js\"],\n\n  // Setting this to false will disable the cache.\n  cache: true\n});\n```\n\nYou can pass in all other [options](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/api/#options) as well,\nincluding `plugins` and `presets`. But note that the closest [`.babelrc`](https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/)\nto each file still applies, and takes precedence over any options you pass in here.\n\n## Environment variables\n\nBy default `babel-node` and `babel-register` will save to a json cache in your\ntemporary directory.\n\nThis will heavily improve with the startup and compilation of your files. There\nare however scenarios where you want to change this behaviour and there are\nenvironment variables exposed to allow you to do this.\n\n### BABEL_CACHE_PATH\n\nSpecify a different cache location.\n\n```sh\nBABEL_CACHE_PATH=/foo/my-cache.json babel-node script.js\n```\n\n### BABEL_DISABLE_CACHE\n\nDisable the cache.\n\n```sh\nBABEL_DISABLE_CACHE=1 babel-node script.js\n```\n"

Here\nis the list of them in the order of appearance in the function name:\n\n* `i` - perform operation in-place, storing the result in the host object (on\n  which the method was invoked). Might be used to avoid number allocation costs\n* `u` - unsigned, ignore the sign of operands when performing operation, or\n  always return positive value. Second case applies to reduction operations\n  like `mod()`.

Usually, this means that one should:\n\n* Convert inputs to reducted ones\n* Operate on them in reduction context\n* Convert outputs back from the reduction context\n\nHere is how one may convert numbers to `red`:\n\n```js\nvar redA = a.toRed(red);\n```\nWhere `red` is a reduction context created using instructions above\n\nHere is how to convert them back:\n\n```js\nvar a = redA.fromRed();\n```\n\n### Red instructions\n\nMost of the instructions from the very start of this readme have their\ncounterparts in red context:\n\n* `a.redAdd(b)`, `a.redIAdd(b)`\n* `a.redSub(b)`, `a.redISub(b)`\n* `a.redShl(num)`\n* `a.redMul(b)`, `a.redIMul(b)`\n* `a.redSqr()`, `a.redISqr()`\n* `a.redSqrt()` - square root modulo reduction context's prime\n* `a.redInvm()` - modular inverse of the number\n* `a.redNeg()`\n* `a.redPow(b)` - modular exponentiation\n\n## LICENSE\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License.\n\nCopyright Fedor Indutny, 2015.\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a\ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the\n\"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit\npersons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the\nfollowing conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included\nin all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS\nOR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with\nimplementations like `kqueue` available on most \\*nix platforms. Chokidar still\ndoes have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.\n\nOn other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which\navoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate\nwatchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been\nspecified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much\nmore than needed.\n\n## Getting started\nInstall with npm:\n\n    npm install chokidar --save\n\nThen `require` and use it in your code:\n\n```javascript\nvar chokidar = require('chokidar');\n\n// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles\nchokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {\n  console.log(event, path);\n});\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Example of a more typical implementation structure:\n\n// Initialize watcher.\nvar watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {\n  ignored: /(^|[\\/\\\\])\\../,\n  persistent: true\n});\n\n// Something to use when events are received.\nvar log = console.log.bind(console);\n// Add event listeners.\nwatcher\n  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))\n  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));\n\n// More possible events.\nwatcher\n  .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))\n  .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))\n  .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))\n  .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))\n  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {\n    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);\n  });\n\n// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second\n// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats\nwatcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {\n  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);\n});\n\n// Watch new files.\nwatcher.add('new-file');\nwatcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);\n\n// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem\nvar watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();\n\n// Un-watch some files.\nwatcher.unwatch('new-file*');\n\n// Stop watching.\nwatcher.close();\n\n// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)\nchokidar.watch('file', {\n  persistent: true,\n\n  ignored: '*.txt',\n  ignoreInitial: false,\n  followSymlinks: true,\n  cwd: '.',\n  disableGlobbing: false,\n\n  usePolling: true,\n  interval: 100,\n  binaryInterval: 300,\n  alwaysStat: false,\n  depth: 99,\n  awaitWriteFinish: {\n    stabilityThreshold: 2000,\n    pollInterval: 100\n  },\n\n  ignorePermissionErrors: false,\n  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)\n});\n\n```\n\n## API\n\n`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`\n\n* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched\nrecursively, or glob patterns.\n* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:\n\n#### Persistence\n\n* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process\nshould continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to\n`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted\nafter `ready`, even if the process continues to run.\n\n#### Path filtering\n\n* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)\nDefines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is\ntested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it\ngets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second\ntime with two arguments (the path and the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject of that path).\n* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while\ninstantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).\n* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the\nsymlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following\nthe link references and bubbling events through the link's path.\n* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be\nderived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.\n* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as\nliteral path names, even if they look like globs.\n\n#### Performance\n\n* `usePolling` (default: `false`).\nWhether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling\nleads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is\ntypically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over\na network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other\nnon-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on OS X overrides the\n`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable\nto true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.\n* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)\n  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also \n    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.\n  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system\n  polling for binary files.\n  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))\n* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on OS X). Whether to use the\n`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly\nand `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When\nset to `false` on OS X, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.\n* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set\nthis to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't\nalready available from the underlying watch events.\n* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of\nsubdirectories will be traversed.\n* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).\nBy default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before\nthe entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`\nevents will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,\nespecially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the\nwrite operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.\nSetting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,\nholding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a\nconfigurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily\ndependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should\nbe relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.\nUse with caution.\n  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust\n  timing params:*\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in\n  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.\n\n#### Errors\n* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files\nthat don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`\nor `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.\n* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).\nAutomatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use\n\"atomic writes\" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is\nre-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event\nrather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well\nfor you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in\nmilliseconds.\n\n### Methods & Events\n\n`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:\n\n* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.\nAvailable events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,\n`raw`, `error`.\nAdditionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event\nname and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.\n* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.\n* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file\nsystem being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the\ndirectories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the\nvalues are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.\n\n## CLI\n\nIf you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out\n[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to\nexecute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.\n\n## Install Troubleshooting\n\n* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`\n  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is\n    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,\n    Chokidar should function properly.\n\n* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable \"python\" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`\n  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:\n    `npm config set python python2.7`\n\n* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`\n  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2016 Paul Miller (http://paulmillr.com) & Elan Shanker\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Ready for changes'))\n  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {\n    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);\n  });\n\n// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second\n// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats\nwatcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {\n  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);\n});\n\n// Watch new files.\nwatcher.add('new-file');\nwatcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);\n\n// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem\nvar watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();\n\n// Un-watch some files.\nwatcher.unwatch('new-file*');\n\n// Stop watching.\nwatcher.close();\n\n// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)\nchokidar.watch('file', {\n  persistent: true,\n\n  ignored: '*.txt',\n  ignoreInitial: false,\n  followSymlinks: true,\n  cwd: '.',\n  disableGlobbing: false,\n\n  usePolling: true,\n  interval: 100,\n  binaryInterval: 300,\n  alwaysStat: false,\n  depth: 99,\n  awaitWriteFinish: {\n    stabilityThreshold: 2000,\n    pollInterval: 100\n  },\n\n  ignorePermissionErrors: false,\n  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)\n});\n\n```\n\n## API\n\n`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`\n\n* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched\nrecursively, or glob patterns.\n* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:\n\n#### Persistence\n\n* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process\nshould continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to\n`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted\nafter `ready`, even if the process continues to run.\n\n#### Path filtering\n\n* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)\nDefines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is\ntested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it\ngets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second\ntime with two arguments (the path and the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject of that path).\n* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while\ninstantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).\n* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the\nsymlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following\nthe link references and bubbling events through the link's path.\n* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be\nderived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.\n* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as\nliteral path names, even if they look like globs.\n\n#### Performance\n\n* `usePolling` (default: `false`).\nWhether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling\nleads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is\ntypically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over\na network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other\nnon-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the\n`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable\nto true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.\n* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)\n  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also\n    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.\n  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system\n  polling for binary files.\n  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))\n* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the\n`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly\nand `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When\nset to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.\n* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the\n[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)\nobject that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set\nthis to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't\nalready available from the underlying watch events.\n* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of\nsubdirectories will be traversed.\n* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).\nBy default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before\nthe entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`\nevents will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,\nespecially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the\nwrite operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.\nSetting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,\nholding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a\nconfigurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily\ndependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should\nbe relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.\nUse with caution.\n  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust\n  timing params:*\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in\n  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.\n  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.\n\n#### Errors\n* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files\nthat don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`\nor `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.\n* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).\nAutomatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use\n\"atomic writes\" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is\nre-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event\nrather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well\nfor you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in\nmilliseconds.\n\n### Methods & Events\n\n`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:\n\n* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.\nAvailable events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,\n`raw`, `error`.\nAdditionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event\nname and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.\n* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.\nTakes an array of strings or just one string.\n* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.\n* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file\nsystem being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the\ndirectories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the\nvalues are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.\n\n## CLI\n\nIf you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out\n[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to\nexecute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.\n\n## Install Troubleshooting\n\n* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`\n  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is\n    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,\n    Chokidar should function properly.\n\n* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable \"python\" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`\n  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:\n    `npm config set python python2.7`\n\n* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`\n  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools\n\n## License\n\nThe MIT License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (c) 2012-2019 Paul Miller (https://paulmillr.com) & Elan Shanker\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

Some people seem to be afraid of extending `String.prototype` and prefer the second way. \n\nIf you are writing good code you will never have an issue with the first approach. If you really don't want to touch `String.prototype`, the second usage will not touch `String` native object.\n\n## Disabling Colors\n\nTo disable colors you can pass the following arguments in the command line to your application:\n\n```bash\nnode myapp.js --no-color\n```\n\n## Console.log [string substitution](http://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/console.html#console_console_log_data)\n\n```js\nvar name = 'Marak';\nconsole.log(colors.green('Hello %s'), name);\n// outputs -> 'Hello Marak'\n```\n\n## Custom themes\n\n### Using standard API\n\n```js\n\nvar colors = require('colors');\n\ncolors.setTheme({\n  silly: 'rainbow',\n  input: 'grey',\n  verbose: 'cyan',\n  prompt: 'grey',\n  info: 'green',\n  data: 'grey',\n  help: 'cyan',\n  warn: 'yellow',\n  debug: 'blue',\n  error: 'red'\n});\n\n// outputs red text\nconsole.log(\"this is an error\".error);\n\n// outputs yellow text\nconsole.log(\"this is a warning\".warn);\n```\n\n### Using string safe API\n\n```js\nvar colors = require('colors/safe');\n\n// set single property\nvar error = colors.red;\nerror('this is red');\n\n// set theme\ncolors.setTheme({\n  silly: 'rainbow',\n  input: 'grey',\n  verbose: 'cyan',\n  prompt: 'grey',\n  info: 'green',\n  data: 'grey',\n  help: 'cyan',\n  warn: 'yellow',\n  debug: 'blue',\n  error: 'red'\n});\n\n// outputs red text\nconsole.log(colors.error(\"this is an error\"));\n\n// outputs yellow text\nconsole.log(colors.warn(\"this is a warning\"));\n```\n\n*Protip: There is a secret undocumented style in `colors`. If you find the style you can summon him.*"

Most of the files in this collection are for applications\nthat are expected to run in obsolete web browsers. For most purposes, json2.js\nis the best choice.\n\n\njson2.js: This file creates a JSON property in the global object, if there\nisn't already one, setting its value to an object containing a stringify\nmethod and a parse method. The parse method uses the eval method to do the\nparsing, guarding it with several regular expressions to defend against\naccidental code execution hazards. On current browsers, this file does nothing,\nprefering the built-in JSON object.\n\njson.js: This file does everything that json2.js does. It also adds a\ntoJSONString method and a parseJSON method to Object.prototype. Use of this\nfile is not recommended.\n\njson_parse.js: This file contains an alternative JSON parse function that\nuses recursive descent instead of eval.\n\njson_parse_state.js: This files contains an alternative JSON parse function that\nuses a state machine instead of eval.\n\ncycle.js: This file contains two functions, JSON.decycle and JSON.retrocycle,\nwhich make it possible to encode cyclical structures and dags in JSON, and to\nthen recover them. JSONPath is used to represent the links.\nhttp://GOESSNER.net/articles/JsonPath/\n"

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include\n      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate\n      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright {yyyy} {name of copyright owner}\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.\n"

This class should inherit from an `EventEmitter` class\nwhich uses the `emit` function to emit events. For example:\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nvar EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter\n  , emits = require('emits');\n\nfunction Example() {\n  EventEmitter.call(this);\n}\n\nrequire('util').inherits(Example, EventEmitter);\n\n//\n// You can directly assign the function to the prototype if you wish or store it\n// in a variable and then assign it to the prototype. What pleases you more.\n//\nExample.prototype.emits = emits; // require('emits');\n\n//\n// Also initialize the example so we can use the assigned method.\n//\nvar example = new Example();\n```\n\nNow that we've set up our example code we can finally demonstrate the beauty of\nthis functionality. To create a function that emits `data` we can simply do:\n\n```js\nvar data = example.emits('data');\n```\n\nEvery time you invoke the `data()` function it will emit the `data` event with\nall the arguments you supplied. If you want to \"curry\" some extra arguments you\ncan add those after the event name:\n\n```js\nvar data = example.emits('data', 'foo');\n```\n\nNow when you call `data()` the `data` event will receive `foo` as first argument\nand the rest of the arguments would be the ones that you've supplied to the\n`data()` function.\n\nIf you supply a function as the last argument we assume that this is an async\nargument parser. This allows you to modify the arguments, prevent the event from\nbeing fired or just clear all supplied arguments (except for the ones that are\ncurried in). The first argument of the function is always the callback function,\nall other arguments after that are the ones emitted with the event. The callback\nfunction follows the usual error first pattern. When the callback is invoked\nwith an error it will emit an `error` event on the `EventEmitter` instance. In\nour case the `example` instance:\n\n```js\nvar data = example.emits('data', function parser(next, arg) {\n  try { arg = JSON.parse(arg); }\n  catch (e) { return next(e); }\n\n  next(undefined, arg);\n});\n```\n\nTo modify the data you need to supply the change as second argument:\n\n```js\nvar data = example.emits('data', function parser(next, arg) {\n  next(undefined, 'bar');\n});\n```\n\nIn the example above we've transformed the incoming argument to `bar`. So when\nyou call `data()` it will emit a `data` event with `bar` as the second argument.\nIf you call the callback with `undefined` as second argument we assume that no\nmodifications have been made and we emit all received arguments. If you want to\nclear all received arguments, call the callback with `null`:\n\n```js\nvar data = example.emits('data', function parser(next, arg) {\n  next(undefined, null);\n});\n```\n\n### Patterns\n\nIn Primus the most common pattern for this module is to proxy events from one\ninstance to another:\n\n```js\neventemitter.on('data', example.emits('data'));\n```\n\nIt is also very useful to re-format data. For example, in the case of WebSockets,\nif we don't want to reference `evt.data` every time we need to access the data,\nwe can parse the argument as following:\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket('wss://example.org/path');\nws.onmessage = example.emits('data', function parser(next, evt) {\n  next(undefined, evt.data);\n});\n```\n\nIn the example above we will now emit the `data` event with a direct reference\nto `evt.data`. The following final example shows how you can prevent events\nfrom being emitted.\n\n```js\nvar ws = new WebSocket('wss://example.org/path');\nws.onmessage = example.emits('data', function parser(next, evt) {\n  var data;\n\n  try { data = JSON.parse(evt.data); }\n  catch (e) { return next(e); }\n\n  if ('object' !== typeof data || Array.isArray(data)) return;\n\n  next(undefined, data);\n});\n```\n\nBy not calling the callback we make sure that the event is not emitted. So the\n`data` event will only be fired if we've received a valid JSON document from the\nserver and it's an object.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"

These plugins can extend the functionality of the library, adding other ways for files/contexts to be resolved.\r\n\r\nA plugin should be a `class` (or its ES5 equivalent) with an `apply` method. The `apply` method will receive a `resolver` instance, that can be used to hook in to the event system.\r\n\r\n### Plugin Boilerplate\r\n```js\r\nclass MyResolverPlugin {\r\n  constructor(source, target) {\r\n    this.source = source;\r\n    this.target = target;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  apply(resolver) {\r\n    resolver.plugin(this.source, (request, callback) => {\r\n      // Any logic you need to create a new `request` can go here\r\n      resolver.doResolve(this.target, request, null, callback);\r\n    });\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlugins are executed in a pipeline, and register which event they should be executed before/after. In the example above, `source` is the name of the event that starts the pipeline, and `target` is what event this plugin should fire, which is what continues the execution of the pipeline. For an example of how these different plugin events create a chain, see `lib/ResolverFactory.js`, in the `//// pipeline ////` section.\r\n\r\n## Tests\r\n\r\n``` javascript\r\nnpm test\r\n```\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/webpack/enhanced-resolve.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/webpack/enhanced-resolve)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Passing options from webpack\r\nIf you are using `webpack`, and you want to pass custom options to `enhanced-resolve`, the options are passed from the `resolve` key of your webpack configuration e.g.:\r\n\r\n```\r\nresolve: {\r\n  extensions: ['', '.js', '.jsx'],\r\n  modules: ['src', 'node_modules'],\r\n  plugins: [new DirectoryNamedWebpackPlugin()]\r\n  ...\r\n},\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012-2016 Tobias Koppers\r\n\r\nMIT (http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\r\n"

Error codes are processed case-insensitive.\n\nYou will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.\n\n<a name=\"customerrors\"></a>\n## Custom errors\n\nUse `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.\n\n```js\nvar create = require('errno').custom.createError\nvar MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error\nvar SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError\nvar OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)\n\n// use them!\nif (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')\n\nif (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))\n```\n\nAlso available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:\n\n```js\nfs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {\n  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))\n  // do something else\n})\n```\n\nThe resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.\n\n## Contributors\n\n* [bahamas10](https://github.com/bahamas10) (Dave Eddy) - Added CLI\n* [ralphtheninja](https://github.com/ralphtheninja) (Lars-Magnus Skog)\n\n## Copyright & Licence\n\n*Copyright (c) 2012-2015 [Rod Vagg](https://github.com/rvagg) ([@rvagg](https://twitter.com/rvagg))*\n\nMade available under the MIT licence:\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished\nto do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

    "licenseText": "### Esrecurse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse)\n\nEsrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is\n[ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)\nrecursive traversing functionality.\n\n### Example Usage\n\nThe following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(ast, {\n    XXXStatement: function (node) {\n        this.visit(node.left);\n        // do something...\n        this.visit(node.right);\n    }\n});\n```\n\nWe can use `Visitor` instance.\n\n```javascript\nvar visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({\n    XXXStatement: function (node) {\n        this.visit(node.left);\n        // do something...\n        this.visit(node.right);\n    }\n});\n\nvisitor.visit(ast);\n```\n\nWe can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.\n\n```javascript\nclass Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {\n    constructor()\n    {\n        super(null);\n    }\n\n    XXXStatement(node) {\n    }\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\nfunction DerivedVisitor() {\n    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);\n}\nutil.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);\nDerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {\n    this.visit(node.left);\n    // do something...\n    this.visit(node.right);\n};\n```\n\nAnd you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.\n\n```javascript\nfunction DerivedVisitor() {\n    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);\n}\nutil.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);\nDerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {\n    // do something...\n    this.visitChildren(node);\n};\n```\n\nThe `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of `this.visitChildren(node)`.\nWe can use user-defined node types.\n\n```javascript\n// This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.\nvar tree = {\n    type: 'TestExpression',\n\n    // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.\n    argument: {\n        type: 'Literal',\n        value: 20\n    },\n\n    // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.\n    extended: true\n};\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        // Extending the existing traversing rules.\n        childVisitorKeys: {\n            // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]\n            TestExpression: ['argument']\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\nWe can use the `fallback` option as well.\nIf the `fallback` option is `\"iteration\"`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes.\nPlease note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: 'iteration'\n    }\n);\n```\n\nIf the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.\nPlease note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).\n\n```javascript\nesrecurse.visit(\n    ast,\n    {\n        Literal: function (node) {\n            // do something...\n        }\n    },\n    {\n        fallback: function (node) {\n            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {\n                return key !== 'argument'\n            });\n        }\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### License\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 [Yusuke Suzuki](https://github.com/Constellation)\n (twitter: [@Constellation](https://twitter.com/Constellation)) and other contributors.\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without\nmodification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n\n  * Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer.\n\n  * Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright\n    notice, this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the\n    documentation and/or other materials provided with the distribution.\n\nTHIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED BY THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND CONTRIBUTORS \"AS IS\"\nAND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE\nIMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE\nARE DISCLAIMED.

If null, the body is returned as a Buffer.\n\n##### options.body\n\nType: `string`, `Buffer`, `ReadableStream`  \n\nBody, that will be sent with `POST` request. If present in `options` and `options.method` is not set - `options.method` will be set to `POST`.\n\nThis option and stream mode are mutually exclusive.\n\n##### options.timeout\n\nType: `number`\n\nMilliseconds after which the request will be aborted and an error event with `ETIMEDOUT` code will be emitted.\n\n##### options.agent\n\n[http.Agent](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_agent) instance.\n\nNode HTTP/HTTPS Agent in [0.10](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/v0.10.35-release/lib/http.js#L1261) by default limits number of open sockets to 5 — which is too low. If `options.agent` is not defined `got` will use [infinity-agent](https://github.com/floatdrop/infinity-agent) to backport `defaultMaxSockets` from [0.11](https://github.com/joyent/node/blob/v0.11.14-release/lib/_http_agent.js#L110).\n\n[Why pooling is evil](https://github.com/substack/hyperquest#pooling-is-evil).\n\nTo use default [globalAgent](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_globalagent) just pass `null` to this option.\n\n##### callback(err, data, response)\n\n###### err\n\n`Error` object with HTTP status code as `code` property.\n\n###### data\n\nThe data you requested.\n\n###### response\n\nThe [response object](http://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_http_incomingmessage).\n\n#### got.get(url, [options], [callback])\n#### got.post(url, [options], [callback])\n#### got.put(url, [options], [callback])\n#### got.patch(url, [options], [callback])\n#### got.head(url, [options], [callback])\n#### got.delete(url, [options], [callback])\n\nSets `options.method` to the method name and makes a request.\n\n\n## Proxy\n\nYou can use the [`tunnel`](https://github.com/koichik/node-tunnel) module with the `agent` option to work with proxies:\n\n```js\nvar got = require('got');\nvar tunnel = require('tunnel');\n\ngot('todomvc.com', {\n\tagent: tunnel.httpOverHttp({\n\t\tproxy: {\n\t\t\thost: 'localhost'\n\t\t}\n\t})\n}, function (err, data, res) {});\n```\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT © [Sindre Sorhus](http://sindresorhus.com)\n"

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

We also recommend that a\n      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the\n      same \"printed page\" as the copyright notice for easier\n      identification within third-party archives.\n\n   Copyright 2019 ehmicky <ehmicky@gmail.com>\n\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\n   limitations under the License.\n"

    "licenseText": "iMurmurHash.js\n==============\n\nAn incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).\n\nThis version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js\"></script>\n<script>\n// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\nTo use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:\n\n```bash\nnpm install imurmurhash\n```\n\nThen simply include it in your scripts:\n\n```javascript\nMurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');\n```\n\nQuick Example\n-------------\n\n```javascript\n// Create the initial hash\nvar hashState = MurmurHash3('string');\n\n// Incrementally add text\nhashState.hash('more strings');\nhashState.hash('even more strings');\n\n// All calls can be chained if desired\nhashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');\n\n// Get a result\nhashState.result();\n// returns 0xe4ccfe6b\n```\n\nFunctions\n---------\n\n### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])\nGet a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:\n\n```javascript\n// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same\n// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)\nhashState = MurmurHash3();\n...\n\n// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the\n// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss\n// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.\nhashState = new MurmurHash3();\n```\n\nBoth methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)\nIncrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()\nGet the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.\n\n```javascript\n// Do the whole string at once\nMurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();\n// 0x70529328\n\n// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part\nvar m = MurmurHash3('this is a');\nm.result();\n// 0xbfc4f834\nm.hash(' test string').result();\n// 0x70529328 (same as above)\n```\n\n---\n\n### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])\nReset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.\n\n---\n\nLicense (MIT)\n-------------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gary Court, Jens Taylor\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of\nthis software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in\nthe Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to\nuse, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of\nthe Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so,\nsubject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

[jju.parse()](#jjuparse-function) parses json/json5 text and returns a javascript value it corresponds to\n2. [jju.stringify()](#jjustringify-function) converts javascript value to an appropriate json/json5 text\n3. [jju.tokenize()](#jjutokenize-function) parses json/json5 text and returns an array of tokens it consists of ([see demo](http://rlidwka.github.io/jju/tokenizer.html))\n4. [jju.analyze()](#jjuanalyze-function) parses json/json5 text and tries to guess indentation, quoting style, etc.\n5. [jju.update()](#jjuupdate-function) changes json/json5 text, preserving original formatting as much as possible ([see demo](http://rlidwka.github.io/jju/editor.html))\n\nAll functions are able to work with a standard JSON documents. `jju.parse()` and `jju.stringify()` are better in some cases, but slower than native `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` versions. Detailed description see below.\n\n### jju.parse() function\n\n```javascript\n/*\n * Main syntax:\n *\n * `text` - text to parse, type: String\n * `options` - parser options, type: Object\n */\njju.parse(text[, options])\n\n// compatibility syntax\njju.parse(text[, reviver])\n```\n\nOptions:\n\n - reserved\\_keys - what to do with reserved keys (String, default=\"ignore\")\n   - \"ignore\" - ignore reserved keys\n   - \"throw\" - throw SyntaxError in case of reserved keys\n   - \"replace\" - replace reserved keys, this is the default JSON.parse behaviour, unsafe\n\n     Reserved keys are keys that exist in an empty object (`hasOwnProperty`, `__proto__`, etc.).\n\n```javascript\n// 'ignore' will cause reserved keys to be ignored:\nparse('{hasOwnProperty: 1}', {reserved_keys: 'ignore'}) == {}\nparse('{hasOwnProperty: 1, x: 2}', {reserved_keys: 'ignore'}).hasOwnProperty('x') == true\n\n// 'throw' will cause SyntaxError in these cases:\nparse('{hasOwnProperty: 1}', {reserved_keys: 'throw'}) == SyntaxError\n\n// 'replace' will replace reserved keys with new ones:\nparse('{hasOwnProperty: 1}', {reserved_keys: 'throw'}) == {hasOwnProperty: 1}\nparse('{hasOwnProperty: 1, x: 2}', {reserved_keys: 'ignore'}).hasOwnProperty('x') == TypeError\n```\n\n\n - null\\_prototype - create object as Object.create(null) instead of '{}' (Boolean)\n\n   if `reserved_keys != 'replace'`, default is **false**\n\n   if `reserved_keys == 'replace'`, default is **true**\n\n   It is usually unsafe and not recommended to change this option to false in the last case.\n\n - reviver - reviver function - Function\n\n   This function should follow JSON specification\n\n - mode - operation mode, set it to 'json' if you want to throw on non-strict json files (String)\n\n### jju.stringify() function\n\n```javascript\n/*\n * Main syntax:\n *\n * `value` - value to serialize, type: *\n * `options` - serializer options, type: Object\n */\njju.stringify(value[, options])\n\n// compatibility syntax\njju.stringify(value[, replacer [, indent])\n```\n\nOptions:\n\n - ascii - output ascii only (Boolean, default=false)\n   If this option is enabled, output will not have any characters except of 0x20-0x7f.\n\n - indent - indentation (String, Number or Boolean, default='\\t')\n   This option follows JSON specification.\n\n - quote - enquoting char (String, \"'\" or '\"', default=\"'\")\n - quote\\_keys - whether keys quoting in objects is required or not (String, default=false)\n   If you want `{\"q\": 1}` instead of `{q: 1}`, set it to true.\n\n - sort\\_keys - sort all keys while stringifying (Boolean or Function, default=false)\n   By default sort order will depend on implementation, with v8 it's insertion order. If set to `true`, all keys (but not arrays) will be sorted alphabetically. You can provide your own sorting function as well.\n\n - replacer - replacer function or array (Function or Array)\n   This option follows JSON specification.\n\n - no\\_trailing\\_comma = don't output trailing comma (Boolean, default=false)\n   If this option is set, arrays like this `[1,2,3,]` will never be generated. Otherwise they may be generated for pretty printing.\n\n - mode - operation mode, set it to 'json' if you want correct json in the output (String)\n\n   Currently it's either 'json' or something else. If it is 'json', following options are implied:\n\n   - options.quote = '\"'\n   - options.no\\_trailing\\_comma = true\n   - options.quote\\_keys = true\n   - '\\x' literals are not used\n\n### jju.tokenize() function\n\n```javascript\n/*\n * Main syntax:\n *\n * `text` - text to tokenize, type: String\n * `options` - parser options, type: Object\n */\njju.tokenize(text[, options])\n```\n\nOptions are the same as for the `jju.parse` function.\n\nReturn value is an array of tokens, where each token is an object:\n\n - raw (String) - raw text of this token, if you join all raw's, you will get the original document\n - type (String) - type of the token, can be `whitespace`, `comment`, `key`, `literal`, `separator` or `newline`\n - stack (Array) - path to the current token in the syntax tree\n - value - value of the token if token is a `key` or `literal`\n\nYou can check tokenizer for yourself using [this demo](http://rlidwka.github.io/jju/tokenizer.html).\n\n### jju.analyze() function\n\n```javascript\n/*\n * Main syntax:\n *\n * `text` - text to analyze, type: String\n * `options` - parser options, type: Object\n */\njju.analyze(text[, options])\n```\n\nOptions are the same as for the `jju.parse` function.\n\nReturn value is an object defining a programming style in which the document was written.\n\n - indent (String) - preferred indentation\n - newline (String) - preferred newline\n - quote (String) - `\"` or `'` depending on which quote is preferred\n - quote\\_keys (Boolean) - `true` if unquoted keys were used at least once\n - has\\_whitespace (Boolean) - `true` if input has a whitespace token\n - has\\_comments (Boolean) - `true` if input has a comment token\n - has\\_newlines (Boolean) - `true` if input has a newline token\n - has\\_trailing\\_comma (Boolean) - `true` if input has at least one trailing comma\n\n### jju.update() function\n\n```javascript\n/*\n * Main syntax:\n *\n * `text` - original text, type: String\n * `new_value` - new value you want to set\n * `options` - parser or stringifier options, type: Object\n */\njju.update(text, new_value[, options])\n```\n\nIf you want to update a JSON document, here is the general approach:\n\n```javascript\n// here is your original JSON document:\nvar input = '{\"foo\": \"bar\", \"baz\": 123}'\n\n// you need to parse it first:\nvar json = jju.parse(input, {mode: 'json'})\n// json is { foo: 'bar', baz: 123 }\n\n// then you can change it as you like:\njson.foo = 'quux'\njson.hello = 'world'\n\n// then you run an update function to change the original json:\nvar output = jju.update(input, json, {mode: 'json'})\n// output is '{\"foo\": \"quux\", \"baz\": 123, \"hello\": \"world\"}'\n```\n\nLook at [this demo](http://rlidwka.github.io/jju/editor.html) to test various types of json.\n\n## Advantages over existing JSON libraries\n\nIn a few cases it makes sense to use this module instead of built-in JSON methods.\n\nParser:\n - better error reporting with source code and line numbers\n\nIn case of syntax error, JSON.parse does not return any good information to the user. This module does:\n\n```\n$ node -e 'require(\"jju\").parse(\"[1,1,1,1,invalid]\")'\n\nSyntaxError: Unexpected token 'i' at 0:9\n[1,1,1,1,invalid]\n         ^\n```\n\nThis module is about 5 times slower, so if user experience matters to you more than performance, use this module. If you're working with a lot of machine-generated data, use JSON.parse instead.\n\nStringifier:\n - util.inspect-like pretty printing\n\nThis module behaves more smart when dealing with object and arrays, and does not always print newlines in them:\n\n```\n$ node -e 'console.log(require(\"./\").stringify([[,,,],,,[,,,,]], {mode:\"json\"}))'\n[\n        [null, null, null],\n        null,\n        null,\n        [null, null, null, null]\n]\n```\n\nJSON.stringify will split this into 15 lines, and it's hard to read.\n\nYet again, this feature comes with a performance hit, so if user experience matters to you more than performance, use this module. If your JSON will be consumed by machines, use JSON.stringify instead.\n\nAs a rule of thumb, if you use \"space\" argument to indent your JSON, you'd better use this module instead.\n\n"

We're\nin a modern world now and terminals support more than 16 colors so we are stupid\nto not take advantage of this.\n\n## Installation\n\n```\nnpm install --save kuler\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nKuler provides a really low level API as we all have different opinions on how\nto build and write coloring libraries. To use it you first have to require it:\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nvar kuler = require('kuler');\n```\n\nThere are two different API's that you can use. A constructor based API which\nuses a `.style` method to color your text:\n\n```js\nvar str = kuler('foo').style('#FFF');\n```\n\nOr an alternate short version:\n\n```js\nvar str = kuler('foo', 'red');\n```\n\nThe color code sequence is automatically terminated at the end of the string so\nthe colors do no bleed to other pieces of text. So doing: \n\n```js\nconsole.log(kuler('red', 'red'), 'normal');\n```\n\nWill work without any issues.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n"

The `info` object has\n`title` and `slug` properties with the token content and the slug used\nfor the identifier.\n\n## User-Friendly URLs\n\nStarting from `v5.0.0`, `markdown-it-anchor` dropped package `string`\nkeeping it's core value of being an unopinionated and secure library. Yet,\nusers looking for backward compatibility may want the old slugify:\n\n```sh\n$ npm i -S string\n```\n\n```js\nconst string = require('string')\nconst legacySlugify = s => string(s).slugify().toString()\n\nconst md = require('markdown-it')()\nconst anchor = require('markdown-it-anchor', {\n\tslugify: legacySlugify\n})\n```\n\n## Unicode Support\n\nUnicode is supported by default. Yet, if you are looking for a \"prettier\"\n--opinionated-- link, _i.e_ without %xx, you may want to take a look at `uslug`:\n\n```sh\n$ npm i -S uslug\n```\n\n```js\nconst uslug = require('uslug')\nconst uslugify = s => uslug(s)\n\nconst md = require('markdown-it')()\nconst anchor = require('markdown-it-anchor', {\n\tslugify: uslugify\n})\n```\n\n## Table of Contents\n\nLooking for an automatic table of contents (TOC) generator? Take a look at\n[markdown-it-toc-done-right](https://www.npmjs.com/package/markdown-it-toc-done-right) it's\nmade from the ground to be a great companion of this plugin.\n"

Luckily the defined connection\nstring format accomodates such configurations!\n\nSadly, you do not understand these connection strings, or have unacceptable bugs with\nyour parsing (e.g. uris are uri encoded).\n\nSo, I made a uri parser for you.\n\nPlease find bugs in my code, and help me make it the best mongo connection string\nparser in history.\n\nAND THEN USE IT!\n\nHeads up\n--------\n\nI refuse to make assumptions about defaults as part of the parser. So, if a port\ngoes unspecified, I will say that the port is null (because it is), and it is\nyour job to realize that the default port is 27015.\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n```javascript\nvar MongoURI = require('mongo-uri')\n  , uriString\n  , uri\n  ;\n\n// let's deal with a complicated (yet real-life) uri\nuriString = \"mongodb://%40u%2Fs%3Fe%3Ar:p%40a%2Fs%3Fs%3A@example1.com,example2.com,example3.com:27018/?readPreference=secondary&w=2&wtimeoutMS=2000&readPreferenceTags=dc:ny,rack:1&readPreferenceTags=dc:ny&readPreferenceTags=\";\n\ntry {\n  uri = MongoURI.parse(uriString);\n} catch (err) {\n  // handle this correctly, kthxbye\n}\n\nconsole.log(uri);\n/*\n * username: \"@u/s?e:r\" // yay! it got decoded like it was supposed to!\n * password: \"p@a/s?s:\"\n * hosts: [\"example1.com\", \"example2.com\", \"example3.com\"] // wow, multiple hosts!\n * ports: [null, null, 27018] // remember, I don't assume\n * database: null // what did I just say?\n * options: {\n *   readPreference: \"secondary\",\n *   w: \"2\",\n *   timeoutMS: \"2000\",\n *   readPreferenceTags: [\"dc:ny,rack:1\", \"dc:ny\", \"\"] // yeah, this is correct\n * }\n */\n```\n\nSource\n------\n\nOk, so I made a Tweet (which is as good as a promise) that my next npm module would\nbe in [literate coffeescript](http://ashkenas.com/literate-coffeescript/). So,\nI had fun documenting my code, but I *do not* want the .litcoffee to be transpiled\nupon `npm install` of everbody using this code.\n\nGitHub should store the raw source (without the transpiled lib/*.js contents), but\nnpm should store the ready-to-use no-transpiling-needed javascript!\n\nSo, I created a grunt task to do my publishing. Instead of using `npm publish`, I\nuse `grunt publish` which cleans my directory, compiles my .litcoffee files, and\nthen publishes.\n\nSo, don't hate me for using .litcoffee. You're getting raw javascript goodness\nwhen you npm install me.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nMIT\n"

HERE BEGINS THE INTERESTING STUFF 🚨 -->\n\n## Wut? Poppers?\n\nA popper is an element on the screen which \"pops out\" from the natural flow of your application.  \nCommon examples of poppers are tooltips, popovers and drop-downs.\n\n\n## So, yet another tooltip library?\n\nWell, basically, **no**.  \nPopper.js is a **positioning engine**, its purpose is to calculate the position of an element\nto make it possible to position it near a given reference element.  \n\nThe engine is completely modular and most of its features are implemented as **modifiers**\n(similar to middlewares or plugins).  \nThe whole code base is written in ES2015 and its features are automatically tested on real browsers thanks to [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com/) and [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/).\n\nPopper.js has zero dependencies. No jQuery, no LoDash, nothing.  \nIt's used by big companies like [Twitter in Bootstrap v4](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Microsoft in WebClipper](https://github.com/OneNoteDev/WebClipper) and [Atlassian in AtlasKit](https://aui-cdn.atlassian.com/atlaskit/registry/).\n\n### Popper.js\n\nThis is the engine, the library that computes and, optionally, applies the styles to\nthe poppers.\n\nSome of the key points are:\n\n- Position elements keeping them in their original DOM context (doesn't mess with your DOM!);\n- Allows to export the computed informations to integrate with React and other view libraries;\n- Supports Shadow DOM elements;\n- Completely customizable thanks to the modifiers based structure;\n\nVisit our [project page](https://fezvrasta.github.io/popper.js) to see a lot of examples of what you can do with Popper.js!\n\nFind [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md).\n\n\n### Tooltip.js\n\nSince lots of users just need a simple way to integrate powerful tooltips in their projects,\nwe created **Tooltip.js**.  \nIt's a small library that makes it easy to automatically create tooltips using as engine Popper.js.  \nIts API is almost identical to the famous tooltip system of Bootstrap, in this way it will be\neasy to integrate it in your projects.  \nThe tooltips generated by Tooltip.js are accessible thanks to the `aria` tags.\n\nFind [the documentation here](/docs/_includes/tooltip-documentation.md).\n\n\n## Installation\nPopper.js is available on the following package managers and CDNs:\n\n| Source |                                                                                  |\n|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| npm    | `npm install popper.js --save`                                                   |\n| yarn   | `yarn add popper.js`                                                             |\n| NuGet  | `PM> Install-Package popper.js`                                                  |\n| Bower  | `bower install popper.js --save`                     |\n| unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/popper.js`](https://unpkg.com/popper.js)                     |\n| cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |\n\nTooltip.js as well:\n\n| Source |                                                                                  |\n|:-------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| npm    | `npm install tooltip.js --save`                                                  |\n| yarn   | `yarn add tooltip.js`                                                            |\n| Bower* | `bower install tooltip.js=https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js --save`                   |\n| unpkg  | [`https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js`](https://unpkg.com/tooltip.js)                   |\n| cdnjs  | [`https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js`](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/popper.js) |\n\n\\*: Bower isn't officially supported, it can be used to install Tooltip.js only trough the unpkg.com CDN. This method has the limitation of not being able to define a specific version of the library. Bower and Popper.js suggests to use npm or Yarn for your projects.  \nFor more info, [read the related issue](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/390).\n\n### Dist targets\n\nPopper.js is currently shipped with 3 targets in mind: UMD, ESM and ESNext.\n\n- UMD - Universal Module Definition: AMD, RequireJS and globals;\n- ESM - ES Modules: For webpack/Rollup or browser supporting the spec;\n- ESNext: Available in `dist/`, can be used with webpack and `babel-preset-env`;\n\nMake sure to use the right one for your needs. If you want to import it with a `<script>` tag, use UMD.\n\n## Usage\n\nGiven an existing popper DOM node, ask Popper.js to position it near its button\n\n```js\nvar reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');\nvar popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');\nvar anotherPopper = new Popper(\n    reference,\n    popper,\n    {\n        // popper options here\n    }\n);\n```\n\n### Callbacks\n\nPopper.js supports two kinds of callbacks, the `onCreate` callback is called after\nthe popper has been initialized. The `onUpdate` one is called on any subsequent update.\n\n```js\nconst reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');\nconst popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');\nnew Popper(reference, popper, {\n    onCreate: (data) => {\n        // data is an object containing all the informations computed\n        // by Popper.js and used to style the popper and its arrow\n        // The complete description is available in Popper.js documentation\n    },\n    onUpdate: (data) => {\n        // same as `onCreate` but called on subsequent updates\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Writing your own modifiers\n\nPopper.js is based on a \"plugin-like\" architecture, most of its features are fully encapsulated \"modifiers\".  \nA modifier is a function that is called each time Popper.js needs to compute the position of the popper. For this reason, modifiers should be very performant to avoid bottlenecks.  \n\nTo learn how to create a modifier, [read the modifiers documentation](docs/_includes/popper-documentation.md#modifiers--object)\n\n\n### React, Vue.js, Angular, AngularJS, Ember.js (etc...) integration\n\nIntegrating 3rd party libraries in React or other libraries can be a pain because\nthey usually alter the DOM and drive the libraries crazy.  \nPopper.js limits all its DOM modifications inside the `applyStyle` modifier,\nyou can simply disable it and manually apply the popper coordinates using\nyour library of choice.  \n\nFor a comprehensive list of libraries that let you use Popper.js into existing\nframeworks, visit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page.\n\nAlternatively, you may even override your own `applyStyles` with your custom one and\nintegrate Popper.js by yourself!\n\n```js\nfunction applyReactStyle(data) {\n    // export data in your framework and use its content to apply the style to your popper\n};\n\nconst reference = document.querySelector('.my-button');\nconst popper = document.querySelector('.my-popper');\nnew Popper(reference, popper, {\n    modifiers: {\n        applyStyle: { enabled: false },\n        applyReactStyle: {\n            enabled: true,\n            fn: applyReactStyle,\n            order: 800,\n        },\n    },\n});\n\n```\n\n### Migration from Popper.js v0\n\nSince the API changed, we prepared some migration instructions to make it easy to upgrade to\nPopper.js v1.  \n\nhttps://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/issues/62\n\nFeel free to comment inside the issue if you have any questions.\n\n### Performances\n\nPopper.js is very performant. It usually takes 0.5ms to compute a popper's position (on an iMac with 3.5G GHz Intel Core i5).  \nThis means that it will not cause any [jank](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/trace-event-profiling-tool/anatomy-of-jank), leading to a smooth user experience.\n\n## Notes\n\n### Libraries using Popper.js\n\nThe aim of Popper.js is to provide a stable and powerful positioning engine ready to\nbe used in 3rd party libraries.  \n\nVisit the [MENTIONS](/MENTIONS.md) page for an updated list of projects.\n\n\n### Credits\nI want to thank some friends and projects for the work they did:\n\n- [@AndreaScn](https://github.com/AndreaScn) for his work on the GitHub Page and the manual testing he did during the development;\n- [@vampolo](https://github.com/vampolo) for the original idea and for the name of the library;\n- [Sysdig](https://github.com/Draios) for all the awesome things I learned during these years that made it possible for me to write this library;\n- [Tether.js](http://github.hubspot.com/tether/) for having inspired me in writing a positioning library ready for the real world;\n- [The Contributors](https://github.com/FezVrasta/popper.js/graphs/contributors) for their much appreciated Pull Requests and bug reports;\n- **you** for the star you'll give to this project and for being so awesome to give this project a try 🙂\n\n### Copyright and license\nCode and documentation copyright 2016 **Federico Zivolo**.

    "licenseText": "RAML JSON Schema Expander\n============\n\n### Purpose\nThis library will expand JSON Schema draft 4 schema references in a ramlObject created by raml2obj. It was primarily created for use in raml2html so that schemas which reference other schemas will be expanded instead of leaving \"$ref\": \"foo.json#\". \n\n### Usage\nCurrently you will need to use my fork of raml2html. In the future it may be included with raml2html. \n\n    git clone git@github.com:br-adam-newman/raml2html.git\n    npm install\n    raml2html/bin/raml2html -o Output.html Input.raml\n\n### JSONSchema Requirements\nYour JSON Schema files can be hosted on a web server or file system accessible by the machine that is running raml2html. Your JSON Schema objects must also have an id attribute with the canonical URI for that file. The library will use canonical dereferencing http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html#anchor30 to pull the referenced file and replace the reference with the contents of that file. \n\nThis will happen recursively for all referenced files. There is no cycle checking, it may run until it causes a stack overflow if there is a cycle. It will only fetch the file from the Internet/file system once per run to prevent repetitive IO traffic so that stack overflow should come quickly at least.\n\nExample file events.json is a collection of event objects which must be hosted in a path relative from \"$ref\" to the URL described in \"id\" excluding the events.json part:\n\n    {\n      \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#\",\n      \"id\": \"http://yourserver.example.com/path/to/schemas/events.json#\",\n      \"type\": \"object\",\n      \"description\": \"Collection of events\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"events\": {\n          \"type\": \"array\",\n          \"items\": {\n            \"$ref\": \"event.json#\"\n          }\n        },\n        \"deletions\": {\n          \"type\": \"array\",\n          \"items\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"format\": \"guid\"\n          },\n          \"description\": \"array of guids for items that were deleted since last sync.\"\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    \nExample file event.json:\n    \n    {\n        \"$schema\": \"http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#\",\n        \"id\": \"http://yourserver.example.com/path/to/schemas/event.json#\",\n        \"type\": \"object\",\n        \"description\": \"An event record\",\n        \"properties\": {              \n          \"guid\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"guid\" },      \n          \"lastModified\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"iso8601\" },\n          \"eventStartDate\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"iso8601\" },\n          \"eventEndDate\": { \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"iso8601\" }\n        }\n    }\n    \n### File System IDs\nWith version 1.1.0 support has been added for the id attribute to be a relative or absolute file path. \n\n        \"id\": \"file://relative/path/to/resource.json#\"\n        //or\n        \"id\": \"file:///absolute/path/to/resource.json#\"\n        //or\n        \"id\": \"/path/without/file/scheme/to/resource.json#\"\n        //or\n        \"id\": \"../relative/path/without/file/scheme/to/resource.json\"\n\nThe file:// scheme out front makes it a URI. It will work without it, but it feels wrong. \n    \n### Changelog\n*   1.1.1 - Handle String type mismatch. \n*   1.1.0 - Added support for file:// URI with a relative or absolute path for id attribute.\n*   1.0.2 - Fixed recursive expansion bug\n*   1.0.1 - Initial release\n"

    "licenseText": "# RAML Parser\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/raml-org/raml-js-parser?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/raml-org/raml-js-parser.png)](https://travis-ci.org/raml-org/raml-js-parser)\n[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/raml-org/raml-js-parser.png)](https://david-dm.org/raml-org/raml-js-parser)\n\nThis is a JavaScript parser for [RAML](http://raml.org) version 0.8 as defined in the [0.8 RAML specification](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/raml-0.8.md)\n\nA newer [version](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-js-parser-2) is now available as a beta. It supports RAML 1.0 as well as RAML 0.8.\n\n### Contributing\nIf you are interested in contributing some code to this project, thanks! Please first [read and accept the Contributors Agreement](https://api-notebook.anypoint.mulesoft.com/notebooks#bc1cf75a0284268407e4).\n\nTo discuss this project, please use its [github issues](https://github.com/raml-org/raml-js-parser/issues) or the [RAML forum](http://forums.raml.org/).\n\n## Usage for NodeJS\n\n### Load\n\nLoading a RAML file is as easy as follows:\n\n```javascript\n  var raml = require('raml-parser');\n\n  raml.loadFile('myAPI.raml').then( function(data) {\n    console.log(data);\n  }, function(error) {\n    console.log('Error parsing: ' + error);\n  });\n```\n\nYou can alternatively load from a string containing the api definition:\n\n```javascript\n  var raml = require('raml-parser');\n\n  var definition = [\n    '#%RAML 0.8',\n    '---',\n    'title: MyApi',\n    'baseUri: http://myapi.com',\n    '/Root:'\n  ].join('\\n');\n\n  raml.load(definition).then( function(data) {\n    console.log(data);\n  }, function(error) {\n    console.log('Error parsing: ' + error);\n  });\n```\n\nThe shape of the returned object is (unofficially) documented in this [Typescript interface](https://github.com/aldonline/raml-typescript).\n\n### Abstract Syntax Tree\n\nGenerating an AST from a RAML file is as easy as follows:\n\n```javascript\n  var raml = require('raml-parser');\n\n  var myAPI;\n  raml.composeFile('myAPI.raml').then( function(rootNode) {\n    console.log('Root Node: ' + rootNode)\n  }, function(error) {\n    console.log('Error parsing: ' + error);\n  });\n```\n\nyou can also alternatively generate an AST from a string containing the api definition:\n\n```javascript\n  var raml = require('raml-parser');\n\n  var definition = [\n    '#%RAML 0.8',\n    '---',\n    'title: MyApi',\n    'baseUri: http://myapi.com',\n    '/Root:'\n  ].join('\\n');\n\n  raml.compose(definition).then( function(rootNode) {\n    console.log('Root Node: ' + rootNode)\n  }, function(error) {\n    console.log('Error parsing: ' + error);\n  });\n```\n\n## Usage for In-Browser\n\nUsing the RAML parser from inside the browser requires the user to actually\ninclude the RAML javascript file in a script tag as follows:\n\n```html\n<script src=\"raml-parser.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nfrom there on the usage is pretty much the same as NodeJS, the script\ndefines a *RAML.Parser* object globally which can be used as follows:\n\n```javascript\nRAML.Parser.loadFile('http://localhost:9001/myAPI.raml').then( function(data) {\n  console.log(data)\n}, function(error) {\n  console.log('Error parsing: ' + error);\n});\n```\n\nNotice that the in-browser version can fetch remote API definitions via XHR.\n"

Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\n      meet the following conditions:\n\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\n\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\n          stating that You changed the files; and\n\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\n          the Derivative Works; and\n\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

Trademarks.

    "licenseText": "URI Template JS\r\n===============\r\n\r\nThis is a javascript implementation of [RFC6570](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6570) - URI Template,\r\nand can expand templates up to and including Level 4 in that specification.\r\n\r\nIt exposes a constructor function UriTemplate with the two methods:\r\n\r\n* (static) parse(uriTemplateText) returning an instance of UriTemplate\r\n* expand(variables) returning an string\r\n\r\nBe aware, that a parsed UriTemplate is frozen, so it is stateless. You can reuse instances of UriTemplates.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\nYou can use uritemplate.js in any even not so modern browser (Tested even with IE8 in IE7-Mode), see file demo.html.\r\nBut you can also use it with node:\r\n\r\n**npm install uritemplate**\r\n\r\nand then in a node application:\r\n\r\n    var\r\n        UriTemplate = require('uritemplate'),\r\n        template;\r\n    template = UriTemplate.parse('{?query*})';\r\n    template.expand({query: {first: 1, second: 2}});\r\n    --> \"?first=1&second=2\"\r\n\r\nor within a html document (see also demo.html):\r\n\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"bin/uritemplate.js\"></script>\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\">\r\n        var template = UriTemplate.parse('{?query*}');\r\n        alert(template.expand({query: {first: 1, second: 2}}));\r\n    </script>\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to clone the git project, be aware of the submodule uritemplate-test.\r\nSo you have to to:\r\n\r\n    git clone --recursive https://github.com/fxa/uritemplate-js.git\r\n\r\n    \r\nBuild\r\n-----\r\n    npm install\r\n    npm test\r\n\r\nTests\r\n-----\r\n\r\nThe integration tests are taken from https://github.com/uri-templates/uritemplate-test as a submodule.\r\nThe tests are integrated in the Jakefile.\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\nCopyright 2013 Franz Antesberger\r\n\r\nMIT License, see http://mit-license.org/\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\n-------------\r\n* 0.3.4 minor package.json changes to support npm install and npm test \r\n* 0.3.3 fixed https://github.com/fxa/uritemplate-js/issues/12 Pct-Encoding-Error with chars < 0x100 (missing 0-padding). Thanks to https://github.com/pfraze!\r\n* 0.3.2 fixed https://github.com/fxa/uritemplate-js/issues/11 Problems with older IE versions. Thanks to anozaki!\r\n* 0.3.1 fixed https://github.com/fxa/uritemplate-js/issues/10 thank you, Paul-Martin!\r\n* 0.3.0 introduced UriTemplateError as exception, so the interface changed from string to UriTemplateError (as the rfc suggested)\r\n* 0.2.4 fixed double encoding according [RubenVerborgh] and some Prefix modifiers bugs\r\n* 0.2.3 fixed bug with empty objects ('{?empty}' with '{empty:{}}' shall expand to '?empty=')\r\n* 0.2.2 fixed pct encoding bug with multibyte utf8 chars\r\n* 0.2.1 fixed a bug in package.json\r\n* 0.2.0 heavy project refactoring, splitting source files, introducing jshint (preparation of next steps)\r\n\r\nNext Steps\r\n----------\r\n* Implementing more unit tests (now only a view tests are implemented)\r\n* A new method extract(uri), which tries to extract the variables from a given uri.\r\n  This is harder, than you might think\r\n"

Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\n      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\n      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,\n      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\n      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\n      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a\n      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\n      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct\n      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n   4. Redistribution.

The contents\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\n          as modifying the License.\n\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\n      the conditions stated in this License.\n\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\n\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

You have to pay attention the contents of the ```dist``` directory.\nIt will contain the latest build version so during use you do not need to build it.\nIt will contain two sub-directories one for client-side usage and one for server-side \n(nodejs).\n"

    "licenseText": "# A webpack plugin that wraps output files (chunks) with custom text or code.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstall locally using npm:  \r\n`npm i wrapper-webpack-plugin`\r\n\r\n#### Webpack compatibility\r\n\r\nWorks with *all* current versions of webpack, including 1, 2, and 3.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nThe `WrapperPlugin` class has a single parameter, an object with a `header` and/or `footer` properties. Header text will\r\nbe *prepended* to the output file, footer text will be *appended*. These can be either a string or a function. A string\r\nwill simply be a appended/prepended to the file output. A function is expected to return a string, and will receive the\r\nname of the output file as an argument.\r\n\r\nAn optional `test` property (a string or a `RegExp` object) can control which output files are affected; otherwise all output files will be wrapped.\r\n\r\n## API\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction WrapperPlugin({\r\n    test: string | RegExp,\r\n    header: string | function,\r\n    footer: string | function\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example configuration #1\r\n\r\nWraps bundle files with '.js' extension in a self invoking function and enables strict mode:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar WrapperPlugin = require('wrapper-webpack-plugin');\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  // other webpack config here\r\n  \r\n  plugins: [\r\n    // strict mode for the whole bundle\r\n    new WrapperPlugin({\r\n      test: /\\.js$/, // only wrap output of bundle files with '.js' extension \r\n      header: '(function () { \"use strict\";\\n',\r\n      footer: '\\n})();'\r\n    })\r\n  ]\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example configuration #2\r\n\r\nPrepends bundles with a doc comment:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar WrapperPlugin = require('wrapper-webpack-plugin');\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  // other webpack config here\r\n  \r\n  plugins: [\r\n    new WrapperPlugin({\r\n      header: function (fileName) {\r\n        return '/*! file: ' + fileName + ', created by dev123 */\\n';\r\n      }\r\n    })\r\n  ]\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example configuration #3\r\n\r\nKeeping header in a separate file:\r\n\r\nfile: `header.js`\r\n```javascript\r\n/*!\r\n * my awesome app!\r\n */\r\n```\r\n\r\nfile: `webpack.config`\r\n```javascript\r\nvar fs = require('fs');\r\nvar WrapperPlugin = require('wrapper-webpack-plugin');\r\n\r\nvar headerDoc = fs.readFileSync('./header.js', 'utf8');\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  // other webpack config here\r\n\r\n  plugins: [\r\n    new WrapperPlugin({\r\n      header: headerDoc\r\n    })\r\n  ]\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example configuration #4\r\n\r\nA slightly more complex example using `lodash` templates:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar WrapperPlugin = require('wrapper-webpack-plugin');\r\nvar template = require('lodash.template');\r\nvar pkg = require('./package.json');\r\n\r\nvar tpl = '/*! <%= name %> v<%= version %> | <%= author %> */\\n';\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = {\r\n  // other webpack config here\r\n\r\n  plugins: [\r\n    new WrapperPlugin({\r\n      header: template(tpl)(pkg)\r\n    })\r\n  ]\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Compatibility with other plugins\r\n\r\nThis plugin should play nicely with most other plugins.\r\nE.g. adding the `webpack.optimize.UglifyJsPlugin` plugin to the plugins array *after* the `WrapperPlugin` will result in\r\nthe wrapper text also being minified.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[ISC](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC)\r\n"
