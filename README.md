# move-smart-contracts
Tool for the synthesis and verification of Move smart contracts

This repository was built ontop of the [VeriSolid smart-contracts](https://github.com/VeriSolid/smart-contracts) repository to create a similar interface and configuration set-up. We also made use of the [webgme-react-viz](https://github.com/pmeijer/webgme-react-viz) repository as a wrapper to set up a visualizer as a react component.
